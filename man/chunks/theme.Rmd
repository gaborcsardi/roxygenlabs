The `@theme` tag allows adding CSS and JS files to the HTML version of
the manual pages.

To support `@theme`, you need to use the `roxygenlabs_rd` roclet.
E.g. add this to `DESCRIPTION`:

```
Roxygen: { library(roxygenlabs); list(markdown = TRUE,
    roclets = c("collate", "namespace", "roxygenlabs_rd")) }
```

and then use the `@theme` tag to add CSS/JS files to _all_ manual pages.
Multiple file names can be specicified in a single `@theme` tag, and
file names are relative to the `inst/doc` directory, within the package:

```
#' @theme assets/extra.css assets/rd.js
```

See the `assets/extra.css` and `assets/rd.js` files, included in the
package, for an example CSS/JS theme that has the following changes
compared to plain Rd documentation:

* R code is syntax-highlighted. This includes R code in the "Usage" and
  "Examples" sections, R code created via "r" fences in roxygen's
  markdown, and R code chunks produced by roxygen's `@includeRmd` tag.
* Add a "Copy" button to R code chunks, to copy them to the clipboard.
* Headings have a new style, including a serif font.
* More spacious formatting of arguments and list.
* Restrict the width of the manual page, to avoid very long lines.
