Experimental 'roxygen' Tags and Extensions

## Installation

Once on CRAN, install the package with

```r
install.packages("roxygenlabs")x
```

## Usage

Currently there is no official way to load a package when running
`devtools::document()` or `roxygen2::roxygenize()`, but you can use a trick:
put the package loading code into the `Roxygen` field in `DESCRIPTION`:

```
Roxygen: { library(roxygenlabs); list(markdown = TRUE) }
```

### Conditional examples

The `@examplesIf` tag implements conditional examples, that do not run
when running `example()` and `R CMD check`, unless some condition holds.
You can use this mechanism to avoid running some examples on CRAN and/or
during `R CMD check`, without adding boilerplate code to the examples
themselves. The following example only runs if the computer is online:

```
#' @examplesIf curl::has_internet()
#' curl::curl_fetch_memory("https://httpbin.org/status/200")
```

If you never want to run an example, use `FALSE` as the condition. This
makes sense for examples that take a very long time to run:

```
#' @examplesIf FALSE
#' some very long running computation...
```
