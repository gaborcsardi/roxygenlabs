Experimental 'roxygen' Tags and Extensions

## Installation

Once on CRAN, install the package with

```r
install.packages("roxygenlabs")x
```

## Usage

Currently there is no official way to load a package when running
`devtools::document()` or `roxygen2::roxygenize()`, but you can use a trick:
put the package loading code into the `Roxygen` field in `DESCRIPTION`:

```
Roxygen: { library(roxygenlabs); list(markdown = TRUE) }
```

### Conditional examples

```{r child = "man/chunks/examplesIf.Rmd"}
```

### CSS and Javascript themes

```{r child = "man/chunks/theme.Rmd"}
```
